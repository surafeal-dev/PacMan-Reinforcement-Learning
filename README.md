# PacMan-Reinforcement-Learning
# 🟡 Pacman Q-Learning AI

A Pacman game enhanced with a reinforcement learning agent using **Q-Learning**. This project demonstrates how an AI agent can learn optimal movement strategies through trial and error in a dynamic environment, without prior knowledge of the world.

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 **Reinforcement Learning with Q-Learning**
  - Agent learns optimal policies by exploring the environment and maximizing cumulative rewards.
- 🎯 **Reward-Based Behavior**
  - Positive rewards for eating food, negative rewards for hitting walls or ghosts.
- 🗺️ **Customizable Grid World**
  - Multiple maze configurations for varied training environments.
- 👻 **Basic Ghost Behavior**
  - Ghosts follow simple or fixed patterns to create challenge.
- 📈 **Q-Table Visualization**
  - Optional console output or logs to track agent’s learning progress.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib** (optional for visualization)
- **Pygame** (for game display and interaction)
